### FastApi Practice

Setup:

- First create a pipfile and in dev dependencies you want *fastapi* and *uvicorn* (to run the server)
- Now create a python file similar to fastPractice.py
- To run the file you created in terminal run the following command

    ###**uvicorn file_name:app --reload**

- Remember *app* is subject to the fact that in python file you do the following

    ###*from fastapi import FastAPI*
    ###*app = FastAPI()*
